## Playify

Playify opens all Spotify links in Google Play Music, Amazon Music, YouTube or the GPMDP. [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/NNu1ZseYMt8)

## :warning: WARNING! :warning:

This is the **development branch**.

## Download

You can download Playify from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playify/cniimiiflgmmjmcohcgnofcdiifdifef).

## How it works

It's simple. You click on a Spotify link, and it opens in your streaming service of choice. For the best experience, the [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com) is recommended. If you don't want to open a song in Spotify, add `#no-playify` at the end of the URL.

### GPMDP

To use the Google Play Music Desktop Player, click on the Playify icon in the Chrome Toolbar and select `Google Play Music Desktop Player`. The next time you open a Spotify link, Playify will prompt you to enter a four-digit code that will be displayed in GPMDP. Notice that GPMDP must be running in the background and the Playback API (Websocket API) needs to be enabled.
