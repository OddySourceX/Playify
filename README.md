## Playify

Playify opens all Spotify links in Google Play Music.

### How it works

It's simple. Install it and never worry about it again.

### Download

Unfortunately, this extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store (yet). However, it is still easy to get. Download the latest `.crx` from [here](https://github.com/krmax44/Playify/releases/latest), go to `chrome://extensions` (or click <a href="chrome://extensions">here</a> if you're lazy) and drag & drop the file in it. Confirm the installation and you're done!
