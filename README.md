## Playify

Playify opens all Spotify links in Google Play Music.

### How it works

It's simple. Install it and never worry about it again. If you don't want to be redirected to GPM, add `#nogpm` at the end of your URL.

### Download

You can download Playify from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playify/cniimiiflgmmjmcohcgnofcdiifdifef).

### Future features

 - :ballot_box_with_check: playlists (auto-converted to GPM) (half done, playlists are not getting converted yet, but you will see a list and can play the songs)
 - :ballot_box_with_check: open in [GPMDP](https://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com)
