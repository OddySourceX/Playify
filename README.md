### Download

Unfortunately, this extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store (yet). However, it is still easy to get. Download the latest `.crx` from [here](https://github.com/krmax44/Playify/releases/latest), go to `chrome://extensions` and drag & drop the file in it. Confirm the installation and you're done!
